# Uniform-Cost-Search
Uniform-cost search is a search method that is used to traverse a weighted tree or graph. When each edge has a distinct cost, this algorithm is activated. The uniform-cost search's primary aim is to identify the path to the goal node with the lowest cumulative cost. Uniform-cost search grows nodes based on their route costs from the root node. It may be used to solve any graph or tree when the best cost is desired. The priority queue implements a uniform-cost search method. It puts the highest importance to the lowest total cost. If the route cost of all edges is the same, uniform cost search is identical to BFS algorithm.
